# Participant_Dropout_Classification
## Summary
A C5.0 decision tree was used to classifiy participant dropout from an online research study. Features of participants who drop out can be used to guide future remote protocol development by building in support for demographic-specific retention. Teleresearch protocols require extra planning and thoughtful implementation to keep participants engaged in an environment that is less controlled than in-person research. Using data-driven methods to evaluate the performance and efficiency of teleresearch protocols is critical, including factors that classify dropout.

## Primary Findings
Participants reporting nicotine use, or both nicotine use and cannabis use, are more likely to drop out of the online study compared to people who do not endorse using those substances. People who use nicotine and cannabis products may have difficulty sustaining attention compared to nonusers.

## Study Design Recommendations
* Decrease study completion time. Use shorter, validated versions of surveys and tasks.
* Add in optional breaks at multiple points throughout data collection.
* Gamify tasks to engage particpiants.
* Personalize testing experience to build virtual rapport with participants.
* Debug all issues and solicit participant feedback to optimize user experience.
